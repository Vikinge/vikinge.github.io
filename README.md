Web Porting
I am very close to shutting down my server that has been up since July 2001. I am relocating data and have determined that shutting down my server ($25/mo) is the best financial decision. I have tried to like Google Pages and Google Sites, but both are too restrictive and in June of 2009 Google is shutting down Pages, which is the only area with limited Javascript support.

So this might become my new web presence.![image](https://github.com/Vikinge/vikinge.github.io/assets/725760/8c4c8363-405a-49ad-9292-e7a159e1f689)
